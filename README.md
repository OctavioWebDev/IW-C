  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
  
- **Backend**:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
